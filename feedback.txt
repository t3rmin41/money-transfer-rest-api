"In the application the implementation used singleton, which is not the best pattern to use.
The double lock idiom used to implement a singleton pattern was not implemented correctly - solution not thread safe.
synchronizedMap is not the best option for concurrent map
Thread safety attempt leads to poor performance.
Liked stress tester." 

"The task was generally done. There is some test coverage.
There are some inconsistencies with the task requirements:
- Obvious error cases are not checked (Negative transfer amount, transfer to the same account)
- There is no check for deadlock while processing transfer.
- Common http error codes are not used.
- There are parameters in code that is not used.
- The need to use both java and kotlin is not clear.
Although the overall task was completed, we expected to see a different level of implementation quality."
